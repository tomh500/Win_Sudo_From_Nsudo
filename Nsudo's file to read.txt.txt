PS:
    1. All NSudo command arguments is case-insensitive.
    2. You can use the "/" or "--" override "-" and use the "=" override ":" in
       the command line parameters.  For example, "/U:T" and "-U=T" are 
       equivalent.
    3. To ensure the best experience, NSudoC does not support context menu.

    If you want to run Command Prompt with TrustedInstaller, enable all 
    privileges and the default Integrity Level.
        NSudo -U:T -P:E cmd
```
Example：If you want to run Command Prompt with TrustedInstaller, enable all 
privileges and the default Integrity Level
> NSudo -U:T -P:E cmd

You can edit NSudo.json to custom the Shortcut list, here are the demo 
(NSudo.json in the NSudo.exe's folder):
```
{
  "ShortCutList_V2": {

    "Command Prompt": "cmd",
    "PowerShell": "powershell",
    "PowerShell ISE": "powershell_ise",
    "Edit Hosts": "notepad %windir%\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts"
  }
}
```
Starting from NSudo 5.0.1708.16, the command line nested quotes is supported. 
For example: 
> NSudo -U:T cmd /c "dir "C:\Program Files" & pause"
