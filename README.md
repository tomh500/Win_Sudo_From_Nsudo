# Win_Sudo_From_Nsudo
use Nsudo.exe to use super user.And upseted,make it look like a linux su.
This exe is just for study.
if you have any question about 版权 you should let me know.

so,how to use it?
I didn't release it,you have to download score.zip and free it.
and add System32 to your path if you didn't add it.
then,you should copy every file to system32 without cpp file.(sure,you can do that)
OK!start your cmd and input "su"
you can get a super cmd with passwd.
passwd is 742371, if you wanna edit it,
you should start cpp and edit with translate.
UH...
the cpp is too esay that it look like a rubbish and rubbish person's work
but it's just study?isn't it?
hahaha

ok let's say again.

First.add system32 in your path

Then.copy all file to system32

next.start a cmd

last.input "su"

passwd is 742371

edit it please start cpp to do that
